Community Management and Engagement Outline


Community Structure

Create a Discord server dedicated to the IBM training program.

Organize the server into grouped channels based on focus areas and activities.



Channel Categories

General Information

Welcome Channel

Announcements

FAQs



Training Discussions

IBM Ecosystem

Watson Technical & Sales

Practical Deployment



Project Submissions

General Project Submissions

IBM Solutions Showcase



Resources & Support

Useful Links

Study Materials



Certification Hub

Certification Discussions

Badge Sharing





Engagement Activities

Weekly check-ins or Q&A sessions.

Monthly project or showcase presentations.

Discussion prompts and topic of the week.

Feedback requests on resources and training materials.



Moderation and Guidelines

Establish clear community guidelines for respectful and constructive interaction.

Set behavioral expectations for engagement.

Appoint moderators to oversee discussions and maintain community standards.




Step-by-Step Guide to Initiate Setup

Step 1: Create the Discord Server

Go to Discord and log in or create an account.

Click on the “+” icon on the left sidebar to create a new server.

Choose "Create My Own" and name the server (e.g., "IBM Training Cohort").


Step 2: Create Channel Categories and Channels

Right-click on the server name and select "Create Category."

Name the category (e.g., "Community Information").

Within each category, create channels. For example:

Right-click on the category and select "Create Channel."

Name it "Welcome" for the welcome message channel.

Repeat for other channels based on the outlined categories.




Step 3: Set Up Roles

Create roles for moderators, project submitters, and general participants.

Right-click the server name > "Server Settings" > "Roles" > "Create Role."

Name the roles (e.g., "Moderator," "Participant").

Assign permissions for each role (e.g., moderators can manage messages, kick members).




Step 4: Appoint Moderators

Choose trusted individuals to act as moderators.

Give them the "Moderator" role and brief them on their responsibilities:

Moderating chat discussions.

Enforcing community guidelines.

Leading engagements and Q&As.




Step 5: Establish Community Guidelines

Draft and pin a set of community guidelines in the "Welcome" channel.

Include rules for conduct, participation etiquette, and how to submit projects.


Step 6: Create Initial Engagement Activities

Schedule a welcome meeting to introduce participants and moderators.

Plan weekly discussions or events to keep members engaged.

Announce these activities in the "Announcements" channel.


Step 7: Promote Project/Certification Submissions

Encourage members to share their review/project/certification links in the appropriate channels.

Pin messages/instructions on how and where to submit these links for visibility.


Step 8: Feedback and Iteration

Regularly solicit feedback from community members to improve engagement activities.

Adjust channel organization or guidelines based on community input.


Moderation Responsibilities


Monitor all channels to ensure respectful behavior.

Facilitate discussions and respond to queries.

Organize events and discussions on relevant topics.

Provide helpful resources and encourage participation in projects and showcases.


By following this structured approach, you can create a vibrant and supportive community for developers in the IBM training program on Discord, fostering collaboration and engagement.
