Kijani Event API - Two-Week Development Work Plan
 Project Idea
Kijani Event API is a comprehensive event management platform designed specifically for community managers to seamlessly integrate event functionality into their websites. The API enables communities to create, manage, and promote local events while providing attendees with easy registration and discovery features. "Kijani" (Swahili for "green/growth") reflects the platform's goal of fostering community growth through organized events.

 Main Features (MVP - Two Weeks)
